<h1>Future Career Goal</h1>
<p> My future career goal is to become a Graphic/WEb Designer for The Walt Dinsey Imagineering Compnay! I have always dreamed of working for Disney and have been inspired fromthe company's creativity. My father was a Walt Diney Imagineer for 15 years and I have always wanted to be able to be apart of that magical experience he contributed to.Some of the think that I want to accomplish for Disney is creating new logos, posters,packaging and anything advertising their merchandise,
attractions,shows, theme parks,ect.I would also like to work on different graphics through out their them parks. A graet example of this would be the World of Color and how the they use elemants ond principles od design to crreate the water show. Suvh include, lighting,sound, speacial effects,ect.In order to recieve my cridentials that will help me at WDI I wouldlike to go to an art school like The Art Center or Otis the college of Art and Design. Both schools offer great graphic/web design programs and recurit students to WDI.
